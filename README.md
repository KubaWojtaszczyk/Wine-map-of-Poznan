This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

My first simple app made as a final assignment during Coders Lab bootcamp Link: https://kubawojtaszczyk.github.io/Wine-map-of-Poznan/.

Wine map of Poznan helps wine tasters find the best wine spots in Poznan, Poland. Users get not only the map but also the coherent information about particular places, such as opening hours, the phone number and the address. After the visit they can rank the winery and a wine of the week, which (in the future development of the app) every winery owner could add to the page.

I used:

- React.js
- React-Leaflet (and openstreetmap.org)
- for creating wine spots API: firebase.google.com
